      # Module


      The Remote Link module allows third-party providers to add a generic link
      through a public REST API and associate it with Jira issues or services.


      Supplied remote link information will be presented in the right sidebar of
      the new Jira issue view under Releases.


      This module also provides actions, which allows users to perform an action
      on the remote link.


      Note that the module key and name are not private and should therefore not
      contain any sensitive or personally identifiable information.


      ## Example Module


      An example can also be found at
      [jira-data-provider-sample-addon](https://bitbucket.org/atlassianlabs/jira-data-provider-sample-addon/src/master/),
      which has an `atlassian-connect.json`.

      body: >
        Welcome to the Jira Software Cloud REST API reference. You can use this
        REST API to build add-ons for Jira Software,

        develop integrations between Jira Software and other applications, or
        script interactions with Jira Software. This page

        documents the REST resources available in Jira Software Cloud, along
        with expected HTTP response codes and sample

        requests.


        Jira Software is built on the Jira platform. As such, there is an
        overlap in functionality

        between what is provided by Jira Software and what is provided by the
        Jira platform. The REST API reference for the

        Jira Cloud platform is here: [Jira Cloud platform REST
        API](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest).


        ## Authentication


        ### Authentication for Atlassian Connect add-ons


        If you are integrating with the Jira REST APIs via an Atlassian Connect
        add-on, API calls are authenticated via JWT

        (JSON Web Tokens). This is built into the supported Atlassian Connect
        libraries. At a high level, authentication works

        by the add-on exchanging a security context with the application. This
        context is used to create and validate JWT

        tokens, embedded in API calls. To learn more, read the [Atlassian
        Connect authentication
        documentation](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/authentication-for-apps/).


        Some integration APIs such as [Feature Flags](#api-group-Feature-Flags)
        are only available to Atlassian Connect apps that

        define the relevant
        [module](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/about-jira-modules/)
        related to that API.

        Other APIs, such as the [Development
        Information](#api-group-Development-Information),
        [Builds](#api-group-Builds), and [Deployments](#api-group-Deployments)
        APIs

        are available to both Atlassian Connect apps and on-premises tools using
        Jira Software's

        [OAuth
        credentials](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/software/integrate-jsw-cloud-with-onpremises-tools/)
        for system-to-system integration.


        ### Authentication for REST API requests


        If you are integrating directly with the REST APIs, rather than via an
        Atlassian Connect add-on, use one of the

        authentication methods listed below:

        * [OAuth
        2.0](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/software/scopes-for-oauth-2-3LO-and-forge-apps/)
        -
          This token-based method is the recommended method. It is more flexible and secure than other options.
         * [OAuth 1.0a](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-rest-api-oauth-authentication) -
         This is a legacy authentication method and, therefore, isn't recommended. Instead use OAuth 2.0.
         * [Basic HTTP](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-rest-api-basic-authentication/) -
         This method is only recommended for tools like scripts or bots. It is easier to implement, but much less secure.

        Note, Jira itself uses cookie-based authentication in the browser, so
        you can call REST from Javascript on the page and

        rely on the authentication that the browser has established. To
        reproduce the behavior of the Jira log-in page (for

        example, to display authentication error messages to users) can `POST`
        to the `/auth/1/session`
        [resource](https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/cloud/#auth/1/session).


        ### Authentication for on-premises integrations


        If you are integrating an on-premises app with the Jira REST APIs, API
        calls are authenticated via an OAuth token.

        To obtain a token, create a set of OAuth credentials with permissions
        for the APIs that app needs to access.

        Use the credentials to request a token by calling
        `https://api.atlassian.com/oauth/token`.

        See [Integrating Jira Software Cloud with on-premises
        tools](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/software/integrate-jsw-cloud-with-onpremises-tools/)
        for details.

        Note that only the [Development
        Information](#api-group-Development-Information),
        [Builds](#api-group-Builds), and [Deployments](#api-group-Deployments)
        APIs are currently available for on-premises integrations.

        To simplify development, we have a separate [downloadable API
        spec](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/software/on-premise-swagger.json).


        Atlassian has developed an [open source plugin for
        Jenkins](https://github.com/jenkinsci/atlassian-jira-software-cloud-plugin),
        which you can use to bootstrap development.

        This plugin uses the authentication method described above and calls the
        Builds and Deployments APIs.



        #### Base URL differences


        When building an on-premises integration, the base URL for API
        operations is different to the base URL used for Connect apps. This is
        because requests from on-premises integrations (OAuth) need to be sent
        via the Atlassian API proxy at `https://api.atlassian.com`.


        This document does not display the base URLs used by on-premises
        integrations. Therefore, when using an operation, you must replace
        `https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/{type}/{version}/{operation}`

        with
        `https://api.atlassian.com/jira/{type}/{version}/cloud/{cloudId}/{operation}`.


        For example:

        * Builds API: Change the path from
        `https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/builds/0.1/bulk` to
        `https://api.atlassian.com/jira/builds/0.1/cloud/{cloudId}/bulk`.

        * Development Information: Change the path from
        `https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/devinfo/0.10/bulk` to
        `https://api.atlassian.com/jira/devinfo/0.1/cloud/{cloudId}/bulk`. Note
        the version change.

        * Deployments: Change the path from
        `https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/deployments/0.1/bulk` to
        `https://api.atlassian.com/jira/deployments/0.1/cloud/{cloudId}/bulk`.


        Note, get the `cloudId` for a Jira instance by calling
        `https://your-domain.atlassian.net/_edge/tenant_info`.



        ## URI structure


        Jira Agile's REST APIs provide access to resources (data entities) via
        URI paths. To use a REST API, your application

        will make an HTTP request and parse the response. The Jira Agile REST
        API uses [JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON)

        as its communication format, and the standard HTTP methods like `GET`,
        `PUT`, `POST` and `DELETE` (see API descriptions

        below for which methods are available for each resource). URIs for Jira
        Agile's REST API resource have the following

        structure:

            http://host:port/context/rest/api-name/api-version/resource-name

        Currently there are two API names available, which will be discussed
        further below:

         * `auth` - for authentication-related operations, and
         * `api` - for everything else.

        The current API version is `1`. However, there is also a symbolic
        version, called `latest`, which resolves to the

        latest version supported by the given Jira Software Cloud instance. For
        example, if you wanted to retrieve the JSON

        representation of a board with `boardId=123`, from a Jira Software Cloud
        instance at `https://jira.atlassian.net`, you

        would access:

            https://jira.atlassian.net/rest/agile/latest/board/123

        ## Pagination


        Pagination is used for the Jira REST APIs to conserve server resources
        and limit response size for resources that

        return potentially large collection of items. A request to a pages API
        will result in a values array wrapped in a JSON

        object with some paging metadata, like this:


        #### Request

            http://host:port/context/rest/api-name/api-version/resource-name?startAt=0&maxResults=10

        #### Response


        ```javascript

        {
            "startAt" : 0,
            "maxResults" : 10,
            "total": 200,
            "values": [
                { /* result 0 */ },
                { /* result 1 */ },
                { /* result 2 */ }
            ]
        }

        ```

         * `startAt` - the item used as the first item in the page of results.
         * `maxResults` - how many results to return per page.
         * `total` - the number of items that the calling user has permissions for. This number *may change* while the client requests the next pages. A client should always assume that the requested page can be empty. REST API consumers should also consider the field to be optional. This value may not be included in the response, if it is too expensive to calculate.

        Clients can use the `startAt`, `maxResults`, and `total` parameters to
        retrieve the desired number of results. Note,

        each API resource or method may have a different limit on the number of
        items returned, which means you can ask for

        more than you are given. The actual number of items returned is an
        implementation detail and this can be changed over

        time.


        ## Experimental methods


        Methods marked as experimental may change without an earlier notice. We
        are looking for your feedback for these methods.


        ## Query parameters


        All query parameters for the resources described below are optional,
        unless specified otherwise.


        ## Special Request and Response headers

         -   **X-Atlassian-Token** (request): Operations that accept multipart/form-data must include the `X-Atlassian-Token: no-check` header in requests.
        Otherwise the request will be blocked by XSRF protection.

        -   **X-AACCOUNTID** (response): This response header contains the
        Atlassian account ID of the authenticated user.


        ## Jira Software field input formats


        Jira Software provides a number of custom fields, which are made
        available in the Jira platform REST API. The custom

        fields are: `Sprint`, `Epic link`, `Epic name`, and `Story points`.


        You can read and edit these custom fields via the [issue
        resource](https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/cloud/#api/2/issue)

        of the Jira Platform REST API. In order to identify the custom field
        that you want to read or edit, you'll need the

        custom field id. To obtain the custom field id, retrieve the list of
        fields from the [fields
        resource](https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/latest/#api/2/field-getFields)

        and search for the custom field. It's better to find the field based on
        the schema where possible (e.g. the Sprint

        field is identified by "`com.pyxis.greenhopper.jira:gh-sprint`"), as
        custom field names are mutable. The custom field

        id will be in the id, (e.g. `id: customfield_10007`).


        If you only need to get the value of the custom field for a single
        issue, you may want to use the [issue
        resource](https://docs.atlassian.com/jira-software/REST/cloud/#agile/1.0/issue-getIssue)

        provided by the Jira Software REST API instead. This resource returns
        the issue with all Jira Software-specific fields,

        including the fields listed above. These fields will also be formatted
        as proper fields with keys, in the response.


        Note, Jira Software also has a number of internal custom fields, which
        are: `Epic Color`, `Epic Status`, `Flag`, `Rank`.

        These internal fields shouldn't be read or updated using the REST API
        and are not documented below.


        ##### Sprint custom field


        The Sprint custom field contains a list of sprints for a given issue.
        This list includes the active/future sprint that

        the issue is currently in, as well as any closed sprints that the issue
        was in previously.


        For legacy reasons, the [Get issue (Jira platform)
        method](https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/cloud/#api/2/issue-getIssue)

        returns the Sprint custom field with sprints in a `toString` format,
        which is difficult to parse. See the example below.


        _**Deprecation notice:** The `toString` representation of sprints in the
        Sprint custom field that is returned by Get

        issue (Jira platform) will soon be removed. See the
        [notice](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/deprecation-notice-tostring-representation-of-sprints-in-get-issue-response/)._


        ###### Example - Get issue (Jira platform) response


        ```javascript

        customfield_11458": [
            "com.atlassian.greenhopper.service.sprint.Sprint@1bf75fd[id=1,rapidViewId=1,state=CLOSED,name=Sprint 1,goal=Sprint 1 goal,startDate=2016-06-06T21:30:53.537+10:00,endDate=2016-06-20T21:30:00.000+10:00,completeDate=2016-06-06T21:30:57.523+10:00,sequence=1]",
            "com.atlassian.greenhopper.service.sprint.Sprint@1689feb[id=2,rapidViewId=1,state=FUTURE,name=Sprint 2,goal=Sprint 2 goal,startDate=<null>,endDate=<null>,completeDate=<null>,sequence=2]"
        ]

        ```


        If you want to parse the sprint information, use either the [Get issue
        (Jira Software)
        method](https://docs.atlassian.com/jira-software/REST/cloud/#agile/1.0/issue-getIssue)

        or [Get issue (Jira platform)
        method](https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/cloud/#api/2/issue-getIssue)
        with expanded

        `versionedRepresentations` instead, both of which return sprints in a
        proper format. See the example below.


        ###### Example - Get issue (Jira platform) response with expanded
        versionedRepresentations


        ```javascript

        "customfield_10021": {
            "1": [
                "com.atlassian.greenhopper.service.sprint.Sprint@1bf75fd[id=1,rapidViewId=1,state=CLOSED,name=Sprint 1,goal=Sprint 1 goal,startDate=2016-06-06T21:30:53.537+10:00,endDate=2016-06-20T21:30:00.000+10:00,completeDate=2016-06-06T21:30:57.523+10:00,sequence=1]",
                "com.atlassian.greenhopper.service.sprint.Sprint@1689feb[id=2,rapidViewId=1,state=FUTURE,name=Sprint 2,goal=Sprint 2 goal,startDate=<null>,endDate=<null>,completeDate=<null>,sequence=2]"
            ],
            "2": [
                {
                    "id": 1,
                    "name": "Sprint 1",
                    "state": "closed",
                    "boardId": 1
                },
                {
                    "id": 2,
                    "name": "Sprint 2",
                    "state": "future",
                    "boardId": 1
                }
            ]
        }

        ```


        If you want to update a sprint, you need to know the sprint id, which is
        a number. See the example below. Note, an

        issue can only be in one active or future sprint at a time, and only the
        active/future sprint can edited.


        ###### Example - Update issue request


        ```javascript

        "customfield_10021": 2

        ```


        ##### Epic link custom field


        The Epic link custom field contains the key of an epic that a given
        issue belongs to. Be aware that only the issue key

        of the existing epic can be set. Also, the Epic link cannot be set for
        sub-tasks and epics.


        ###### Example


        ```javascript

        "customfield_11458": "EPIC-1"

        ```


        ##### Epic Name


        The Epic name custom field contains the name of an epic that a given
        issue belongs to. Be aware that only the issue key

        of the existing epic can be set. Also, the epic link cannot be set for
        sub-tasks and epics.


        ###### Example


        ```javascript

        "customfield_11410": "Epic Name"

        ```


        ##### Estimation


        Jira Software provides a `Story Points` custom field, however the field
        is just a regular numeric field. The type of

        estimation and field used for estimation is determined by the board
        configuration. You can get this from the

        [board configuration
        resource](https://docs.atlassian.com/jira-software/REST/cloud/#agile/1.0/board-getConfiguration).

        Note that if the estimation field is not on a screen, it cannot be
        edited, and you should use the

        [Estimate issue for board
        method](https://docs.atlassian.com/jira-software/REST/cloud/#agile/1.0/issue-estimateIssueForBoard)
        instead.
