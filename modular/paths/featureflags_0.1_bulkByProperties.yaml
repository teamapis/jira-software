  description: >
    Bulk delete all Feature Flags that match the given request.


    One or more query params must be supplied to specify Properties to delete
    by. Optional param `_updateSequenceId` is no longer supported.

    If more than one Property is provided, data will be deleted that matches ALL
    of the Properties (e.g. treated as an AND).

    See the documentation for the submitFeatureFlags operation for more details.


    e.g. DELETE /bulkByProperties?accountId=account-123&createdBy=user-456


    Deletion is performed asynchronously. The getFeatureFlagById operation can
    be used to confirm that data has been deleted successfully (if needed).


    Only apps that define the Feature Flags module can access this resource.
    This resource requires the 'DELETE' scope.
  parameters:
    - name: _updateSequenceId
      in: query
      deprecated: true
      description: >
        This parameter usage is no longer supported.


        An optional `_updateSequenceId` to use to control deletion.


        Only stored data with an `updateSequenceId` less than or equal to that
        provided will be deleted.

        This can be used help ensure submit/delete requests are applied
        correctly if issued close together.


        If not provided, all stored data that matches the request will be
        deleted.
