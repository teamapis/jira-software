  summary: Create sprint
  description: >-
    Creates a future sprint. Sprint name and origin board id are required. Start
    date, end date, and goal are optional.


    Note that the sprint name is trimmed. Also, when starting sprints from the
    UI, the "endDate" set through this call is ignored and instead the last
    sprint's duration is used to fill the form.
