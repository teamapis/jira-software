  summary: Check if data exists for the supplied properties
  description: >-
    Checks if development information which have all the provided properties
    exists. For example, if request is `GET
    existsByProperties?accountId=123&projectId=ABC` then result will be positive
    only if there is at least one entity or repository with both properties
    `accountId=123` and `projectId=ABC`. Special property `_updateSequenceId`
    can be used to filter all entities with updateSequenceId less or equal than
    the value specified. In addition to the optional `_updateSequenceId`, one or
    more query params must be supplied to specify properties to search by.

        All requests must be signed with either a Connect JWT token or OAuth
        token for an on-premise integration that corresponds to an app installed
        in Jira. If the JWT token corresponds to a Connect app that does not
        define the jiraDevelopmentTool module it will be rejected with a 403.
        See https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2015/01/understanding-jwt/ for
        more details about Connect JWT tokens. See
        https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/software/integrate-jsw-cloud-with-onpremises-tools/
        for details about on-premise integrations.
