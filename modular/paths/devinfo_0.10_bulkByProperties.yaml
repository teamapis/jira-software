  summary: Delete development information by properties
  description: >-
    Deletes development information entities which have all the provided
    properties. Entities will be deleted that match ALL of the properties (i.e.
    treated as an AND). For example if request is `DELETE
    bulk?accountId=123&projectId=ABC` entities which have properties
    `accountId=123` and `projectId=ABC` will be deleted. Special property
    `_updateSequenceId` can be used to delete all entities with updateSequenceId
    less or equal than the value specified. In addition to the optional
    `_updateSequenceId`, one or more query params must be supplied to specify
    properties to delete by. Deletion is performed asynchronously: specified
    entities will eventually be removed from Jira.

        All requests must be signed with either a Connect JWT token or OAuth
        token for an on-premise integration that corresponds to an app installed
        in Jira. If the JWT token corresponds to a Connect app that does not
        define the jiraDevelopmentTool module it will be rejected with a 403.
        See https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2015/01/understanding-jwt/ for
        more details about Connect JWT tokens. See
        https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/software/integrate-jsw-cloud-with-onpremises-tools/
        for details about on-premise integrations.

        An optional property to use to control deletion. Only stored data with
        an updateSequenceId less than or equal to that provided will be deleted.
        This can be used to help ensure submit/delete requests are applied
        correctly if they are issued close together.

        Request has incorrect format. It will fail in the following cases: If no
        query properties are specified. If `_updateSequenceId` is not a numeric
        value. If multiple values of the same property key are specified.
        Deleting data for many property values, for the same property key,
        requires multiple requests to this resource.
