  summary: Store development information
  description: >-
    Stores development information provided in the request to make it available
    when viewing issues in Jira. Existing repository and entity data for the
    same ID will be replaced if the updateSequenceId of existing data is less
    than the incoming data. Submissions are performed asynchronously. Submitted
    data will eventually be available in Jira; most updates are available within
    a short period of time, but may take some time during peak load and/or
    maintenance times.

    - name: Authorization

        All requests must be signed with either a Connect JWT token or OAuth
        token for an on-premise integration that corresponds to an app installed
        in Jira. If the JWT token corresponds to a Connect app that does not
        define the jiraDevelopmentTool module it will be rejected with a 403.
        See https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2015/01/understanding-jwt/ for
        more details about Connect JWT tokens. See
        https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/software/integrate-jsw-cloud-with-onpremises-tools/
