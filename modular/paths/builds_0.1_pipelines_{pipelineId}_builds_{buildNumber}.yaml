      All requests must be signed with either a Connect JWT token or OAuth token
      for an on-premise integration that corresponds to an app installed in
      Jira.


      If the Connect JWT token corresponds to an app that does not define
      `jiraBuildInfoProvider` module it will be rejected with a 403.


      See https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2015/01/understanding-jwt/ for
      more details about Connect JWT tokens.
