    Update / insert Remote Link data.


    Remote Links are identified by their ID, existing Remote Link data for the
    same ID will be replaced if it

    exists and the updateSequenceId of existing data is less than the incoming
    data.


    Submissions are performed asynchronously. Submitted data will eventually be
    available in Jira; most updates are

    available within a short period of time, but may take some time during peak
    load and/or maintenance times.

    The `getRemoteLinkById` operation can be used to confirm that data has been
    stored successfully (if needed).


    In the case of multiple Remote Links being submitted in one request, each is
    validated individually prior to

    submission. Details of which Remote LInk failed submission (if any) are
    available in the response object.


    Only Connect apps that define the `jiraRemoteLinkInfoProvider` module can
    access this resource. This resource

    requires the 'WRITE' scope for Connect apps.

                Examples might be an account or user ID that can then be used to
                clean up data if an account is removed from

                the Provider system.


                Properties are supplied as key/value pairs, a maximum of 5
