        All requests must be signed with either a Connect JWT token or OAuth
        token for an on-premise integration that corresponds to an app installed
        in Jira. If the JWT token corresponds to a Connect app that does not
        define the jiraDevelopmentTool module it will be rejected with a 403.
        See https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2015/01/understanding-jwt/ for
        more details about Connect JWT tokens. See
