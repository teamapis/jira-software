    Update / insert builds data.


    Builds are identified by the combination of `pipelineId` and `buildNumber`,
    and existing build data for the same

    build will be replaced if it exists and the `updateSequenceNumber` of the
    existing data is less than the

    incoming data.


    Submissions are performed asynchronously. Submitted data will eventually be
    available in Jira; most updates are

    available within a short period of time, but may take some time during peak
    load and/or maintenance times.

    The `getBuildByKey` operation can be used to confirm that data has been
    stored successfully (if needed).


    In the case of multiple builds being submitted in one request, each is
    validated individually prior to

    submission. Details of which build failed submission (if any) are available
    in the response object.


    Only Connect apps that define the `jiraBuildInfoProvider` module, and
    on-premise integrations, can access this resource.

    This resource requires the 'WRITE' scope for Connect apps.

                Properties assigned to build data that can then be used for
                delete / query operations.


                Examples might be an account or user ID that can then be used to
                clean up data if an account is removed from

                the Provider system.


                Note that these properties will never be returned with build
                data. They are not intended for use as

                metadata to associate with a build. Internally they are stored
                as a hash so that personal information etc.

                is never stored within Jira.


                Properties are supplied as key/value pairs, a maximum of 5
                properties can be supplied, and keys must not

                contain ':' or start with '_'.

                      You are free to associate issue keys in any way you like.
                      However, we recommend that you use the name

                      of the branch the build was executed on, and extract issue
                      keys from that name using a simple regex. This has

                      the advantage that it provides an intuitive association of
