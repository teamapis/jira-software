  summary: Delete builds by Property
  tags:

  description: >
    Bulk delete all builds data that match the given request.


    One or more query params must be supplied to specify Properties to delete
    by.

    Optional param `_updateSequenceNumber` is no longer supported.

    If more than one Property is provided, data will be deleted that matches ALL
    of the

    Properties (e.g. treated as an AND).


    See the documentation for the `submitBuilds` operation for more details.


    e.g. DELETE /bulkByProperties?accountId=account-123&repoId=repo-345


    Deletion is performed asynchronously. The `getBuildByKey` operation can be
    used to confirm that data has been

    deleted successfully (if needed).


    Only Connect apps that define the `jiraBuildInfoProvider` module, and
    on-premise integrations, can access this resource.

    This resource requires the 'DELETE' scope for Connect apps.
  parameters:
    - name: _updateSequenceNumber
      in: query
      deprecated: true
      description: >
        This parameter usage is no longer supported.


        An optional `_updateSequenceNumber` to use to control deletion.


        Only stored data with an `updateSequenceNumber` less than or equal to
        that provided will be deleted.

        This can be used help ensure submit/delete requests are applied
        correctly if issued close together.


        If not provided, all stored data that matches the request will be
        deleted.

      All requests must be signed with either a Connect JWT token or OAuth token

      If the Connect JWT token corresponds to an app that does not define
      `jiraBuildInfoProvider` module it will be rejected with a 403.
